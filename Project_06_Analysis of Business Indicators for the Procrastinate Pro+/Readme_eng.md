# Business Metrics Analysis — Entertainment App "Procrastinate Pro+"

## Client  
**Procrastinate Pro+** mobile app

---

## Project Objective  
Using the company’s internal data, answer the following questions:
- Where do users come from and what devices do they use?  
- What is the cost of user acquisition across different advertising channels?  
- How much revenue is generated per user?  
- What is the payback period for user acquisition costs?  
- What factors limit user base growth?

---

## Key Findings

### Main Reasons for Inefficient User Acquisition:

- **High advertising costs** in **FaceBoom** and **TipTop** (USA) as well as **AdNonSence** (Europe):  
  - High cost per acquisition (CPA) with a two-week payback period — unprofitable  
  - Poor retention among paying users from FaceBoom and AdNonSence  
  - TipTop channel showed a sharp decline in efficiency — CAC tripled over the period

- **Device-related payback issues:**  
  - Unprofitable on all devices except desktop (PC)  
  - iPhone and Android users show short-term payback, likely due to temporary promotions

## Recommendations for the Marketing Team

- **USA:** As a key market, revise strategies for TipTop and FaceBoom to optimize ad spend and improve traffic quality  
- **Europe:** Reallocate budget away from AdNonSence to more effective channels like LeapBob, OppleCreativeMedia, and WahooNetBanner  
- **Organic traffic:** Focus on engaging and retaining organic users — they represent a large share of the audience  
- **PC and Android:** Increase targeting to boost LTV and retention among these users  
- **US Budget Reallocation:** Shift funds from ineffective sources to MediaTornado, RocketSuperAds, and YRabbit  
- **Mobile user retention:** Develop retention strategies specifically for mobile users — they form the app’s core audience  
- **Mac and iPhone:** Conduct detailed behavioral and competitive analysis to refine acquisition strategies and reduce costs

### Evaluation of YRabbit Channel

Although YRabbit has a very low CAC (**CAC = 0.21**), it also shows:
- Low conversion rate  
- Sharp decline in retention by the end of the period

**Conclusion:** YRabbit likely does not match the target audience. Further investment is not recommended until additional analysis is completed.
