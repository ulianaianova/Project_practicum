# **Analysis of Business Indicators for the Procrastinate Pro+ Entertainment Application**

**Customer**

Procrastinate Pro+ Application

**Research Objective**

Using company data, the analysis aims to address the following questions:
- Where users come from and which devices they use.
- Cost of acquiring users from different advertising channels.
- Revenue generated per client.
- When user acquisition costs break even.
- Factors limiting customer acquisition.

## **Conclusion**

1. **Key Factors Behind Inefficiencies in User Acquisition**
   - High advertising costs associated with FaceBoom and TipTop in the US, and AdNonSence in Europe:
      - High cost per acquisition (CPA) for these channels, with a break-even horizon of two weeks, proving unsustainable.
      - Poor retention rates among paying users from FaceBoom and AdNonSence.
      - TipTop shows minimal effectiveness, with user acquisition costs tripling over the period.
   - Device-Specific Payback Issues:
      - Payback issues persist across devices (Mac, iPhone, Android) except for PC users.
      - iPhone and Android users show initial payback, possibly due to time-sensitive campaigns attracting short-term interest.

2. **Recommendations for the Marketing Department**
   - **United States**: As a primary market, re-evaluate strategies with TipTop and FaceBoom to optimize spending and improve user quality.
   - **Europe**: Reallocate budget from AdNonSence to channels with higher payback, such as LeapBob, OppleCreativeMedia, and WahooNetBanner.
   - **Organic Traffic**: Prioritize engagement with organic users as they represent a significant portion of app visitors.
   - **PC and Android Users**: Increase focus on PC and Android users to boost Lifetime Value (LTV) and retention rates.
   - **Budget Reallocation in the US**: Shift budget from ineffective sources to MediaTornado, RocketSuperAds, and YRabbit.
   - **Mobile User Retention**: Develop targeted retention strategies for mobile users as they comprise the core audience.
   - **Competitive and Audience Analysis for Mac and iPhone**: Conduct in-depth analysis to refine acquisition strategies and reduce costs.

3. **Yrabbit Channel Assessment**
   - The Yrabbit channel, despite a low Cost of Acquisition (CAC = 0.21), has low conversion and sharply declining retention towards the end of the observed period.
   - Conclusion: Yrabbit likely does not align with the app's target audience and should not receive additional investment until further analysis is conducted.
