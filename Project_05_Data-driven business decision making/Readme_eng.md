## Project Objective  
- Prioritize hypotheses proposed by the marketing team  
- Analyze the results of an A/B test and make a data-driven business decision  

### Possible outcomes:
- Stop the test and declare a winning group  
- Stop the test and confirm no significant difference between groups  
- Continue the test for further observation

## Key Findings

### Hypothesis Prioritization

If priority is based on **expected business impact**, focus on the following hypotheses:

1. Launch a birthday discount campaign  
2. Add two new traffic acquisition channels to increase user count by 30%  
3. Add a subscription form to key pages to collect a customer email database

If priority is based on **user reach**, the order shifts as follows:

1. Add a subscription form to all major pages  
2. Add product recommendation blocks to increase conversion and average order value  
3. Add two new traffic acquisition channels

###  A/B Test Analysis

- Statistically significant differences were found in the **average number of orders per user**  
- No significant difference was observed in the **average order value**  

**Recommendation:**  
The test should be stopped.  
Group B showed a statistically significant increase in orders per user.  
Although the average order value was slightly higher in Group B, the difference was not significant enough to justify separate action.
