# **Data-driven Business Decision Making**

**Project Goal**

- Prioritize hypotheses from the list provided by the Marketing Department.
- Analyze the results of A/B testing and make decisions based on the findings.

**Possible Solutions:**

1. Stop the test and declare a winning group.
2. Stop the test and note the absence of differences between groups.
3. Continue the test.

## **Conclusion**

Based on the input data provided by the online store, a study was conducted, and the following recommendations are made.

### Hypothesis Prioritization
To prioritize hypotheses from the Marketing Department's list, focus on the following hypotheses:
   - "Launch a promotion that gives a discount on a product on the customer's birthday."
   - "Add two new traffic acquisition channels to increase user acquisition by 30%."
   - "Add a subscription form to all main pages to build an email customer base."

If prioritization is based on broad user engagement, the order of importance shifts as follows:
   - "Add a subscription form to all main pages to build an email customer base."
   - "Add product recommendation blocks to the site to boost conversion rates and average order value."
   - "Add two new traffic acquisition channels to increase user acquisition by 30%."

### A/B Test Analysis

- Given statistically significant differences in the average number of orders per visitor and no significant differences in average order value, it is recommended to stop the test.
- **Group B** demonstrated a significant increase in orders per visitor, confirmed by statistical analysis.
- The average order value, while slightly higher in Group B, does not warrant further action.
