# User Behavior Analysis â€” Food Delivery Mobile App

## Client  
**Startup:** Mobile app for selling food products.

---

## Project Objective  
Analyze user behavior based on log data and the results of an A/A/B experiment (font change in the app).

---

## General Summary  
The most frequent user actions occur on the main screen and the offers screen, indicating active engagement with the app's core features.  
A significant number of users proceed to the cart and complete purchases, suggesting that many follow the full journey from product discovery to payment.  
**47.7% of users complete the funnel from first interaction to purchase.**

---

### Key Observations:

- **Major user drop-off:**  
  - 38.1% of users do not proceed from the main screen to the offers catalog.  
    This is the most significant drop in the funnel and may indicate usability issues or weak content presentation on the main screen.

- **Funnel behavior:**  
  - 19.2% of users navigate from the offers catalog to a product card  
  - 13.5% move from the product card to successful payment  
  - 48.0% of users complete payment

---

## A/B Test Summary  
No statistically significant differences were observed between the control groups (246 and 247) and the experimental group (248) across all tracked events.  
**This indicates that the font change had no meaningful impact on user behavior or key performance metrics.**
